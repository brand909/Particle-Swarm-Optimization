# Particle-Swarm-Optimization
Using PSO to train an agent to balance a pole

![](CartPole.gif)

PSO is an optimization method in which there is a group of "particles" that each represent an approach to a given problem. As the particles try to find an optimal solution, their behaviors are influenced by the most succesful of the group, causing them to converge, or "swarm", upon such a solution.

This method is not guaranteed to converge to the global optimal solution.
